# broker

Broker abstraction layer — defines the `Broker` and `BrokerStream` ABCs and provides two concrete implementations: the live Zerodha adapter and an in-process paper broker for testing and simulation.

## Key abstractions

**`Broker`** (service/broker.py) — the interface every order-routing component depends on. Concrete impls: `ZerodhaBroker` (live) and `PaperBroker` (simulation).

**`BrokerStream`** (service/broker_stream.py) — WebSocket tick feed. `ZerodhaStream` wraps KiteTicker; `PaperBroker` doubles as a synthetic stream for backtests.

**`AbstractPriceStore`** (api/interfaces.py) — a `Protocol` that gives components read access to the latest tick price. Implemented by `PriceStore` (in-memory dict), updated directly by `KiteIngestor` as validated ticks arrive.

## Credential storage

`BrokerToken` stores the Zerodha access token encrypted with `pgp_sym_encrypt`. The encryption key comes from `TOKEN_SECRET_KEY` in env and never touches the DB.
